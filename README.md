### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do Rust development for web backends and Linux, I also do various small projects (mostly in Rust).   
A lot of my open-source projects happen on a private forge due to just basically superior features over GitHub for certain projects and more data control, but some of the repos are mirrored onto GitHub.   
My Git forge account is over at [https://git.gaycatgirl.sex/evie/](https://git.gaycatgirl.sex/evie/).

My main project is currently [yiffOS](https://yiffos.gay/), An experimental LinuxÂ® distribution with a custom package manager. ([Hosted on its own Git forge](https://git.yiffos.gay))

Another large project I'm working on is [Epl](https://git.gaycatgirl.sex/epl/epl), a Rust based reimplementation of the Discord backend which intends to be compatible with [Litecord](https://gitlab.com/litecord/litecord)'s ecosystem.

I'm also writing a voice server for [Litecord](https://gitlab.com/litecord/litecord) and [Epl](https://git.gaycatgirl.sex/epl/epl) following the [LVSP](https://gitlab.com/litecord/litecord/-/blob/master/docs/lvsp.md) protocol called [bannana pho](https://git.gaycatgirl.sex/litecord/bannana-pho), though this is due for a complete rewrite.
