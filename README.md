### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do Rust development for web backends and Linux, I also do various small projects (mostly in Rust).   
A lot of my open-source projects happen on GitLab due to just basically superior features over GitHub for certain projects, but the repos are mirrored onto GitHub.   
My GitLab is [uwueviee](https://gitlab.com/uwueviee).

My main project is currently [yiffOS](https://yiffos.gay/), An experimental LinuxÂ® distribution with a custom package manager. ([Hosted on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yiffos))

I will also sometimes work on [Lightspeed.tv](https://lightspeed.tv), mostly just ops right now.

I'm also writing a voice server for the [Litecord](https://gitlab.com/litecord/litecord) project following the [LVSP](https://gitlab.com/litecord/litecord/-/blob/master/docs/lvsp.md) protocol called [bannana pho](https://gitlab.com/uwueviee/bannana-pho) using Rust, Tokio, Tungstenite, and Redis.
