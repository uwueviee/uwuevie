### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do Rust development for web backends and Linux, I also do various small projects (mostly in Rust).   
A lot of my open-source projects happen on GitLab due to just basically superior features over GitHub for certain projects, but the repos are mirrored onto GitHub.   
My GitLab is [uwueviee](https://gitlab.com/uwueviee).

My main project is currently [yiffOS](https://yiffos.gay/), An experimental LinuxÂ® distribution with a custom package manager. ([Hosted on a custom Gitea instance](https://git.yiffos.gay))
